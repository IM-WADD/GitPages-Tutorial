# An introduction to GitHub Pages and how we will use it in WADD 

Hopefully you are all comfortable with using Git in MPIE. If not, now is the time to go do [this tutorial](https://github.com/UoY-IM-MPIE/mpie-git-tutorial). Once done, come back here! 

In WADD, we are going to be using GitHub for our practicals. Much like MPIE, each practical task and associated files will be available as sepereate repositories. As usual, you should copy the repository for the practical in your own GitHub account with the "use this template button". For WADD, we can edit our repository settings to be able to view our code as a website. You can then edit, push and see your changes live. This tutorial will walk you through the steps to be able to do this. 

1. Click the "use this template" button and copy this repository to your own account.
2. Go to the settings page: ![Screenshot of Github top navbar, highlighting settings button](https://github.com/IM-WADD/GitPages-Tutorial/assets/5978932/9ba2e74b-8966-4be9-b476-e5eddedad795)
